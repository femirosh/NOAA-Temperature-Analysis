# NOAA-Temperature-Analysis
This project involves analyzing historical temperature data from NOAA for the region near Ann Arbor, Michigan, spanning the years 2005-2015. The primary objectives are to:

Visualize Record Temperatures: Identify and plot the record high and low temperatures for each day of the year over a ten-year period (2005-2014). The plot includes shaded areas representing the range between these extremes.
Highlight 2015 Record Breakers: Overlay data from 2015 to highlight any days where the temperatures exceeded the ten-year records.
Map Weather Stations: Visualize the geographic locations of weather stations in the dataset using an interactive map.
This analysis provides insights into temperature trends and station distribution, with the results presented through clear visualizations.
